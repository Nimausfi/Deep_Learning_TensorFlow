# **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Tensorflow**


### **Summary**
Summary about the entire project (detaset + preprocessing + transfer learning and fine-tuning + models + feature extraction + callbacks (OPTIONAL) + test and evaluate).


### **Dataset**
Dataset can be accessed and downloaded from Kaggle: [Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)

This dataset contains images of Fruits and Vegetables:

**Fruits:** banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango.

**Vegetables:** cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, raddish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soy bean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chilli pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalepe√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant.

### **Models**

**Transfer Learning:** All pre-trained models were implemented from [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) as a starting point, moreover, fine-tuning employed to further training the pre-trained models by updating its weights.

**Fine-Tuning:** To fine-tune the base models, first set its trainable attribute to "True" (unfreezing all of the frozen). Then, since there is a relatively small training dataset, re-freeze every layer except for the last 5 (making them trainable).
