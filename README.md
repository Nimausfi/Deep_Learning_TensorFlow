# **Deep Learning with TensorFlow**

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.

### **Dataset**
Dataset can be accessed and downloaded from Kaggle: [Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)

This dataset contains images of fruits and vegetables, and divided into three folders: train (100 images each), test (10 images each), and validation (10 images each).

**Fruits:** banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango.

**Vegetables:** cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, raddish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soy bean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chilli pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalepe√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant.

### **Models**

**Transfer Learning:** All pre-trained models were implemented from [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) as a starting point, moreover, fine-tuning employed to further training the pre-trained models by updating its weights.

**Fine-Tuning:** To fine-tune the base models, first set its trainable attribute to "True" (unfreezing all of the frozen). Then, since there is a relatively small training dataset, re-freeze every layer except for the last 5 (making them trainable). Check the following link to learn more about the [trainable attributes.](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/)

### **Performance Evaluation**

**Learning curves for training and validation metrics** (fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model)

++ Add learning_curves.jpg

**Comparing the accuarcy scores of base and fine-tuned models on the whole test dataset**

++ Create a table to compare the accuarcy results

**Visualizing predictions on custom images**

++ Add custom_imgs

More results for evaluating predictions such as confusion matrix, f1-score for each class, and finding most wrong predictions are in the source codes.
